But I guess that was too hard for them. I guess that's why I left. I guess that's why I've had nobody up until now. That's none of my problem though, there is nothing wrong with me. Nothing. Oh... I'm so sorry. I don't know what got into me there. That photo just brought all of that out and I got carried away, I'm so sorry you had to hear all that. I feel good though. I feel so much more free.

I was thinking with the power trip route that we end up putting the player in the position of the "queer person" but of course I get if that doesnt flow well. I thought exploring different themes and views through different endings was the plan?? So in this route the Narrator sees the player as "different" and uncooperative as it is the person in power. -matt

I'm really the only company I need but now I have you running around doing who knows what.

I think you forget something though, you can't get rid of me. I may not see where you are but I will always be with you. You can keep running and running but I'll find you. The more you deny it the more fun it gets.
