:: Photo Interact [PARLOUR]
>narrator-It's a photo. I feel like I know who those people are, but I can't quite put my finger on it. This is so strange. I feel weird seeing this photo of these people, I feel like they are really important to me and that they love me very much. *slight gasp* I can't shake this feeling that I've disappointed them. Maybe they don't love me... I really can't be sure anymore. I think we should go now.

You've been pretty cool so far, call me cheesy but I think meeting you is probably the best thing that's happened to me. Granted I can't seem to remember anything prior to meeting you but that's besides the point, haha!

:: Write Smarter [annotation]
-Compress routes- maybe 
  only focus on 2 owing to   
  time/to better construct a 
  narrative
-Think hard about the 
  tone/reactions of the 
  narrator- is it a stereotypical 
  reaction?? How is it portraying the character?
