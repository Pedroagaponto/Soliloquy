03.94|It's not my fault that they couldn't accept me the way I am. 
06.64|Maybe if they really loved me they would put in some effort 
09.47|to understand me instead of trying to change me. 
11.38|I wouldn't need to feel unsafe in a space that's supposed to shelter me. 
15.06|But I guess that was too hard for them. I guess that's why I left. 
18.16|I guess that's why I've had nobody up until now. 
21.02|That's none of my problem though, there is nothing wrong with me. 
23.45|Nothing. Oh... I'm so sorry. I don't know what got into me there.
29.05|That photo just brought all of that out and I got carried away, 
32.53|I'm so sorry you had to hear all that. I feel good though. 
35.83|I feel so much more free. I feel... happy, with myself. 
39.96|That photo doesn't even bother me anymore, haha! 
42.37|Look, I want to show you something!
